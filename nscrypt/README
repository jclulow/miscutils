=== NSCRYPT ==========================================================

 Solaris "encrypts" the LDAP bind password for the system LDAP client
 in the file /var/ldap/ldap_client_cred.  This encryption is really
 just obfuscation and is reversible without a key.  The function for
 doing this is buried somewhere in the ldap client libraries...
   ... this project contains an embedded copy of the routine and 
        two standalone wrappers, all licensed under the CDDL.
